## Reasoning

For higher quality of teaching, a more realistic way of working for the students is useful. For this purpose
the experts interviewed listed various techniques that should be taught:

* Working with IDEs
* Versioning with GIT
* Project management with Jira/Kanban and others
* Formal notation of software

In addition, more advanced programming aspects are mentioned that should also be implemented:

* Building visual interfaces
* Integration of libraries
* Use of the debugger
* Modern practices like Test-Driven-Development
