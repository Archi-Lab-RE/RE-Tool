## Beschreibung
Martin is 42 years old and works as a mechanic for an organization that provides
organization that provides roadside assistance to customers. He has been working in this profession for 12 years and
knows it well. Many of the younger mechanics ask Martin for advice when they meet at the depot, because he always knows the
answer to tricky mechanical problems. Martin likes to share his
knowledge with the younger ones, because it makes him feel like a valued part of the team.

Martin works rotating day and night shifts and spends his shifts taking care of
Breakdowns and lockouts (when customers leave their keys
keys are left in the car). About 20% of the jobs he completes are complex
and he occasionally has to refer back to his standard manuals. Martin tries not to use the manuals
use them in front of customers because he thinks it gives the impression that he doesn't know what he's doing.

Martin has seen many changes in the company over the years and tries his best to keep up with the times.
However, he found it a bit disheartening when a new computer was installed in his van a few years ago.
And now he's heard rumors that the computer will be upgraded to one with a larger screen, which is supposed to be faster and better.
Martin has been told that he will be able to access the intranet with the new computer. He has already
heard about the intranet and once saw it in an early version on his manager's computer.

He wonders if it will make it easier for him to find out what's going on in the company, especially since it seems that customers will be
know more about the latest company news than he does when he's
is on a job. This can be embarrassing and has been a source of frustration for Martin during his time at the company.

Martin wonders if he will be able to cope with the new computer system. He doesn't mind asking
asking his grandchildren for help when he wants to send an e-mail to his brother overseas, but asking the guys at work for help is another story.
